🏦 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

  

📌 Overview

Credit card fraud is a major financial threat, and machine learning can play a vital role in detecting fraudulent transactions. This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a Credit Card Fraud Detection Model using Google Colab and Machine Learning algorithms.

🚀 Features

✅ Data Preprocessing (Handling Imbalanced Data, Feature Scaling)
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualizations
✅ Implementation of ML Algorithms (Logistic Regression as primary model)
✅ Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC Curve)
✅ Fraud Prediction on New Transactions

📁 Dataset

We use the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains anonymized transaction details with labels (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent). The dataset is loaded from /content/creditcard.csv in Google Colab.
